District 7 includes 5 cities and sections of unincorporated Miami-Dade County. To best address the additional infrastructure problems facing families and businesses in the district, the city and county governments must work together. We have roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure on which we all rely that need to be addressed. We must clean up and remediate the contamination in many of our county parks within the district that have been closed or abandoned. We have been deprived of the natural and recreational public resources due to neglect by the county and the diversion of tax dollars. To address these concerns, we must have bold leadership and collaboration between the cities and county. I have a proven track record of working with municipal, business and community leaders within the district and will do so as the County Commissioner for District 7.
