# Endless Traffic Gridlock

Every day drivers and users of transit in Miami-Dade experience anger and frustration from the battle they face to get to work or other obligations of daily life. We were promised transit and we donâ€™t have it. We voted for a half-penny tax to expand transit options 20 years ago, the county has failed to deliver. Poor planning, failed leadership, and subverting the dedicated funding for transit expansion to cover daily transportation operations has left all of us as prisoners in our own cars. 

I am committed to fighting for true transit expansion that would provide relief for all of District 7. During my term as Mayor of Pinecrest, I joined with other South Dade mayors, legislators and commissioners demanding the expansion of the Metrorail from Dadeland to Homestead, but our demands have still not been met. I am committed to continue that fight until it is realized. A true one ticket Metrorail ride would alleviate much of the traffic gridlock along US 1. Likewise, the Kendall community has not had any transit options even considered for the past two decades. County planning must incorporate and provide real transit and mobility options for Kendall.
