# Flooding and Rising Seas

Because our county and the entire eastern border of District 7 is on the coast, we are particularly vulnerable to the effects from rising seas. Whether we are talking about flooding and other damage from the increasingly extreme weather patterns, these problems must be tackled through meaningful investments in infrastructure. 

For the past decade I have focused on addressing these issues at the municipal, county, and regional level. We must collaborate with businesses and community members to plan for and invest in adaptive measures to protect our homes, businesses, schools and families from this growing threat. As your county commissioner, I will continue to make this a priority and will bring the stakeholders together to address these issues.
